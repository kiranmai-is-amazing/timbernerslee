        <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on June 8, 1955. His parents were Mary Lee Woods and Conway
            Berners-Lee; he had three siblings. The Berners-Lee couple worked with the very first ever commercial
            computer, the Ferranti Mark 1 so you could say that computers were his legacy.

            He attended Sheen Mount Primary school then spent four years at Emanuel School in south west London. As a
            child, he was a very keen train-spotter and learned all about electronics through playing with his model
            railway.

            After his school years, Berners-Lee enrolled at the University of Oxford at Queenâ€™s College for three years
            and received a first class degree in physics in 1976.</p>
